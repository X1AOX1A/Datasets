Download the annotations and metadata file [dataset_flickr.tgz](https://ailb-web.ing.unimore.it/publicfiles/drive/show-control-and-tell/dataset_flickr.tgz) (~32.8 MB) and extract it in the code folder using `tar -xzvf dataset_flickr.tgz`. 

Download the pre-computed features file [flickr30k_detections.hdf5](https://ailb-web.ing.unimore.it/publicfiles/drive/show-control-and-tell/flickr30k_detections.hdf5) (~13.1 GB) and place it under the `datasets/flickr` folder, which gets created after decompressing the annotation file.
