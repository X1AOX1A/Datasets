# COCO Entities
Download the annotations and metadata file [dataset_coco.tgz](https://ailb-web.ing.unimore.it/publicfiles/drive/show-control-and-tell/dataset_coco.tgz) (~85.6 MB) and extract it in the code folder using `tar -xzvf dataset_coco.tgz`. 

Download the pre-computed features file [coco_detections.hdf5](https://ailb-web.ing.unimore.it/publicfiles/drive/show-control-and-tell/coco_detections.hdf5) (~53.5 GB) and place it under the `datasets/coco` folder, which gets created after decompressing the annotation file.
